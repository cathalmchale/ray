[The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) in .NET Core.


## inspiration

Interested in a new coding challenge. Found [this](https://github.com/simonech/ray-tracer-challenge-netcore) repository and decided that I want to do the same. I'm not forking that repository because:

* The [book and challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) are presented as chapter-by-chapter and test driven.
    * So to work effectively I'll have to start from zero myself.
* I want to try using cuecumber / BDD style testing and this repo doesn't.

However I do plan to follow both the book and the [blog](https://codeclimber.net.nz/). So [simonech](https://github.com/simonech) will give me a good head-start. Perhaps I will fork the repo at a later date and offer some suggestions, depending on my findings.
